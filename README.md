# fast_vessel_detection

To achieve the goal of developing (semi-)autonomous boats, reliable vision-based methods for vessel detection, classification, and tracking are needed. This repository contains the code of a machine learning approach for vessels detection from a moving and zooming camera. In particular, the proposed method is supervised and derives from a fast and robust people detection algorithm [Dollar et al., 2014]. Ground-truth annotations are also contained in this repository.
